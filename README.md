## Introduction

This project demonstrates the integration of [HeyApi](https://heyapi.co), [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), and [Tanstack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) in a modern React application built with TypeScript and Vite. The goal is to showcase a real-world example of how to manage API requests, client-side caching, and routing in a performant and scalable React application.

By combining these powerful tools, this project helps developers build efficient data-fetching strategies, optimize user experiences, and create maintainable applications with minimal configuration overhead.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript** - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- **Vite** - A fast development build tool
- **HeyApi** - A powerful API service for building and managing APIs easily
- **Tanstack Query** - A powerful asynchronous state management library for handling API requests and caching
- **Tanstack Router** - A lightweight routing solution optimized for React

## Project Structure
- **Prerequisites**

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
## Key Features

- API Management with HeyApi: Integration with HeyApi for seamless API request handling.
- Data Fetching Caching with Tanstack Query: Efficiently fetch and cache data to improve performance.
- Routing with Tanstack Router: Lightweight and modern routing for React applications.
- TypeScript Support: Ensures type safety and scalability with TypeScript throughout the app.
- Vite for Fast Builds: Instant server start and fast hot module replacement (HMR) during development.

## Usage
1. To define API endpoints and manage data fetching, navigate to the src/api and src/services directories.
2. To add routes, use the src/router directory where Tanstack Router is configured.
3. Reusable components can be added to the src/components folder to keep your UI modular.

## Example Code Snippet

Here's a brief example of how to set up Tanstack Query with HeyApi:

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { fetchData } from './api';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useQuery(['key'], fetchData);

  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error loading data</p>;

  return <div>{data?.message}</div>;
};
```
